## My process
- Design analysis: extracting font-styles and colors from figma-file.
- defining CSS variables
- defining CSS utility classes
- writing markup, including styles via utility classes
- writing layout for mobile design
- writing layout for tablet and/or desktop

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Custom CSS Utility classes for fonts and style for max mantainability 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- No frameworks used.


### What I learned

How to build a purely css-slider and the limitations of css for this task.
Thanks a lot to https://ebene11.com/imageslider-ohne-javascript

Limitations are: 
- Nav-Buttons are part of each slider, therefore sliding with the slid.
- navigation in the loop is not possible.

### Continued development

In future: Exchanging the slider for a more sophisiticated JavaScritp one.
